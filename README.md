## My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue) / Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black)
  _by Neil Young_

```diff
- Hey, hey, my, my
+ My my, hey hey
- Rock and roll can never die
+ Rock and roll is here to stay
- There's more to the picture than meets the eye
+ It's better to burn out than to fade away
- Hey, hey, my, my
+ My my, hey hey.
  Out of the blue and into the black
- You pay for this and they give you that
+ They give you this, but you pay for that
- Once you're gone, you can't come back
+ And once you're gone, you can never come back
  When you're out of the blue and into the black
  The king is gone but he's not forgotten
- Is this the tale of Johnny Rotten?
+ This is the story of a Johnny Rotten
- It's better to burn out than to fade away
+ It's better to burn out than it is to rust
  The king is gone but he's not forgotten
  Hey, hey, my, my
  Rock and roll can never die
  There's more to the picture than meets the eye
  Hey, hey, my, my

## Don't Cry / Don't Cry (Alternate Lyrics)
  _by Guns n' Roses_

```diff
- Talk to me softly, there's something in your eyes
+ If we could see tomorrow, what of your plans?
- Don't hang your head in sorrow and please don't cry
+ No one can live in sorrow, ask all your friends
- I know how you feel inside, I've, I've been there before
+ Times that you took in stride, they're back in demand
- Something is changing inside you and don't you know?
+ I was the one who was washing blood off your hands

  Don't you cry tonight, I still love you, baby
  And don't you cry tonight
  Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
  And don't you cry tonight

- Give me a whisper and give me a sigh
+ I know the things you wanted, they're not what you have
- Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye
+ With all the people talking, it's driving you mad
- Don't you take it so hard now and please don't take it so bad
+ If I was standing by you, how would you feel
- I'll still be thinking of you and the times we had, baby
+ Knowing your love's decided, and all love is real? (baby)

  And don't you cry tonight
  Don't you cry tonight
  Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
  And don't you cry tonight

- And please remember that I never lied, oh
+ I thought I could live in your world, as years all went by,
- And please remember how I felt inside now, honey
+ with all the voices I've heard, something has died
- You gotta make it your own way but you'll be alright now, sugar
+ And when you're in need of someone, my heart won't deny you
- You'll feel better tomorrow, come the morning light now, baby
+ So many seem so lonely with no one left to cry to, baby

  Don't you cry tonight
  I still love you, baby
  Don't you cry tonight
  Don't you cry tonight
  There's a heaven above you baby
  And don't you cry tonight
  Don't you cry tonight
  I still love you, baby
  Don't you cry tonight
  Don't you cry tonight
  There's a heaven above you baby
  And don't you cry tonight

## Revolution / Revolution 1
_by The Beatles_

  You say you want a revolution
  Well, you know
  We all want to change the world
  You tell me that it's evolution
  Well, you know
  We all want to change the world

  But when you talk about destruction
- Don't you know that you can count me out
+ Don't you know that you can count me out in

  Don't you know it's gonna be alright
- Alright, 
+ Don't you know it's gonna be alright,
- alright
+ Don't you know it's gonna be alright

  You say you got a real solution
  Well, you know
  We'd all love to see the plan
  You ask me for a contribution
  Well, you know
  We're all doing what we can

  But if you want money for people with minds that hate
  All I can tell you is brother you have to wait

  Don't you know it's gonna be alright
- Alright, 
+ Don't you know it's gonna be alright,
- alright
+ Don't you know it's gonna be alright
- al...
+                                     

  You say you'll change the constitution
  Well, you know
  We all want to change your head
  You tell me it's the institution
  Well, you know
  You'd better free your mind instead

  But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
  You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow

  Don't you know it's gonna be alright
- Alright, 
+ Don't you know it's gonna be alright,
- alright
+ Don't you know it's gonna be alright

  Alright, alright
  Alright, alright
  Alright, alright
  Alright, alright
```
