## My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue) / Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black)
  _by Neil Young_

```diff
- Hey, hey, my, my
+ My my, hey hey
- Rock and roll can never die
+ Rock and roll is here to stay
- There's more to the picture than meets the eye
+ It's better to burn out than to fade away
- Hey, hey, my, my
+ My my, hey hey.
  Out of the blue and into the black
- You pay for this and they give you that
+ They give you this, but you pay for that
- Once you're gone, you can't come back
+ And once you're gone, you can never come back
  When you're out of the blue and into the black
  The king is gone but he's not forgotten
- Is this the tale of Johnny Rotten?
+ This is the story of a Johnny Rotten
- It's better to burn out than to fade away
+ It's better to burn out than it is to rust
  The king is gone but he's not forgotten
  Hey, hey, my, my
  Rock and roll can never die
  There's more to the picture than meets the eye
  Hey, hey, my, my
